                I am an Information Technology student at the University of Santo Tomas with a strong passion for 
                software development. With a solid foundation in programming languages, frameworks, and 
                problem-solving techniques, I am constantly working to hone my skills in both front-end and 
                back-end development. I aspire to become a software engineer, and I am eager to contribute to 
                innovative projects, collaborate with teams, and grow in the dynamic field of technology. 
                Always open to learning, I'm excited about the future and the opportunity to make a positive impact 
                in the tech industry.
